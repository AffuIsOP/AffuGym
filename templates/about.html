      <h2 class="section-title">Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        AffuGym started with a simple idea: make fitness feel exciting, not
        intimidating. We created a space where people of all ages and fitness
        backgrounds can train comfortably, ask questions freely, and see real
        progress without feeling out of place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, we’ve grown into a community hub for early-morning lifters,
        late-night cardio fans, and anyone who just wants that one hour a day
        dedicated to themselves.
